# Cortex Application Layer - Collaboration repository

This repository contains templates that allow developers to contribute with tests, applications and add-ons created using [Google Cloud Cortex Framework Data Foundation]().

Approved contributors can add code to test the touch-points between their solutions and Google Cloud Cortex Framework. This allows us to collaboratively develop solutions, have a single place to discover these innovative apps and helps the Cortex Engineering team to make sure the interfacing points remain operational throughout releases.
