# Cortex Application Layer - Collaboration repository

This repository contains templates that allow partners to contribute with applicatins and add-ons created on top of Google Cloud Cortex frameworks.

Partners can contribute all of the code or just the code that interfaces with the foundation. This allows us to collaboratively develop solutions, have a single place to discover these innovative apps and helps the Cortex Engineering team to make sure the interfacing points remain operational throughout releases.
