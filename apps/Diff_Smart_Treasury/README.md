# Diff Consulting - Bank Data Validation

Bank Data Validation is an application that enhances the capabilities of Treasury and AP users by effectively managing the validity of banks within the system. Built on top of Google Cortex, this application offers a user-friendly interface to facilitate efficient control and correction of bank-related issues.

One of the primary functionalities of the software is its ability to detect and resolve problems associated with duplicate bank keys, as well as vendors and Business Partners utilizing outdated bank keys. By identifying these issues, users can take necessary actions to correct them, ensuring the accuracy and integrity of the bank data.

The application provides a streamlined process for maintaining an updated and organized list of bank data within the system. This proactive approach significantly reduces the occurrence of erroneous payments or rejected payments, thereby minimizing financial errors and improving payment processing efficiency.

While the solution is particularly beneficial for companies that rely on manual bank key creation and lack automated bank key update mechanisms, it also offers value to customers with existing automated bank key systems. Regardless of the level of automation, the software provides essential features for managing bank data effectively.

Overall, Bank Data Validation empowers Treasury and AP users to control, validate, and maintain accurate bank information, resulting in enhanced financial operations and reduced errors in payment processing.
